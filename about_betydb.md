# About BETYdb

# Database Description and User's Guide 

This wiki describes the purpose, design, and use of the Biofuel
Ecophysiological Traits and Yields database (BETYdb). BETYdb is a
database of plant trait and yield data that supports research,
forecasting, and decision making associated with the development and
production of cellulosic biofuel crops. While the content of BETYdb is
agronomic, the structure of the database itself is general and can
therefore be used more generally for ecosystem studies.

Note that this document does not cover the suite of tables used by PEcAn. 
These are covered in the [[ PEcAn documentation | https://github.com/PecanProject/pecan/wiki ]].

## Objectives

A major motivation of the biofuel industry is to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions by providing ecologically and economically sustainable sources
of fuel and dependence on fossil fuel. The goals of this database are to
provide a clearinghouse of existing research on potential biofuel crops;
to provide a source of data on plant ecophysiological traits and yields;
and to present ecosystem-scale re-analysis and forecasts that can
support the agronomic, ecological, policy, and economic aspects of the
biofuel industry. This database will facilitate the scientific advances
and assessments that the transition to biofuels will require.


The objectives of this database are to allow other users access to data
that has been collected from previously published and ongoing research
in a consistent format, and to provide a streamlined interface that
allows users to enter their own data. These objectives will support
specific research and collaboration, advance agricultural practices, and
inform policy decisions. Specifically, BETYdb supports the following
uses, allowing users to:

1.  Carry out statistical analyses to explore the relationships between
    traits

2.  Identify differences among species and functional groups

3.  Access BETYdb from simulation models to look up values for traits
    and parameters

4.  Identify gaps in knowledge about biofuel crop traits and model
    parameters to aid rational planning of research activities

BETYdb provides a central clearinghouse of biofuel crop physiological
traits and yields in a consistently organized framework that simplifies
the use of these data for further analysis and interpretation.
Scientific applications include the development, assessment, and
prediction of crop yields and ecosystem services in biofuel
agroecosystems. The database directly supports parameterization and
validation of ecological, agronomic, engineering, and economic models.
The initial target end-users of BETYdb version 1.0 are users within EBI
who aim to support sustainable biofuel production through statistical
analysis and ecological modeling. By streamlining the process of data
summary, we hope to inspire new scientific perspectives on biofuel crop
ecology that are based on a comprehensive evaluation of available
knowledge.

## Scope


The database contains trait, yield, and ecosystem service data. Because
all plants have the potential to be used as biofuel feedstock, BETYdb
supports data from all plant species. In practice, the species included
in the database reflect available data and the past and present research
interests of contributors. Trait and yield data are provided at the
level of species, with cultivar and clone information provided where
available.

The yield data not only includes end-of-season harvestable yield, but
also includes measurements made over the course of the growing season.
These yield data are useful in the assessment of historically observed
crop yields, and they can also be used in the validation of plant
models. Yield data includes peak biomass, harvestable biomass, and the
biomass of the crop throughout the growing season.

The trait data represent phenotypic traits; these are measurable
characteristics of an organism. The primary objective of the trait data
is to allow researchers to model second generation biofuel crops such as
miscanthus and switchgrass. In addition, these data enable evaluation of
new plant species as potential biofuel crops. Ecosystem service data
reflect ecosystem-level observations, and these data are included in the
traits table.

## Content

BETYdb includes data obtained through extensive literature review of
target species in addition to data collected from the Energy Farm at the
University of Illinois, and by our collaborators. The BETYdb database
contains trait and yield data for a wide range of plant species so that
it is possible to estimate the distribution of plant traits for broad
phylogenetic groups and plant functional types.

BETYdb contains data from intensive efforts to find data for specific
species of interest as well as from previous plant trait and yield
syntheses and other databases. Most of the data currently in the
database is from plant genera that are the focus of our current and previous research. 
These species include perennial grasses, such as miscanthus
(*Miscanthus sinensis*) switchgrass (*Panicum virgatum*), and sugarcane
(*Saccharyn* spp.). BETYdb also includes short-rotation woody species,
including poplar (*Populus* spp.) and willow (*Salix* spp.) and a group
of species that are being evaluated at the energy farm as novel woody
crops. In addition to these herbaceous species, we are collecting data
from a species in an experimental low-input, high diversity prairie.

## Design


BETYdb is a relational database that comprehensively documents available
trait and yield data from diverse plant species ([Figure 1](#Figure-1)). The underlying
structure of BETYdb is designed to support meta-analysis and ecological
modeling. A key feature is the PFT (plant functional type) table which
allows a user to group species for analysis. On top of the database, we
have created a web-portal that targets a larger range of end users,
including scientists, agronimists, foresters, and those in the biofuel
industry.

## Data Entry


The [Data Entry
Workflow](https://dlebauer.gitbooks.io/betydbdoc-dataentry/content/)
provides a complete description of the data entry process. BETYdbâ€™s web
interface has been developed to facilitate accurate and efficient data
entry. This interface provides logical workflow to guide the user
through comprehensively documenting data along with species, site
information, and experimental methods. This workflow is outlined in the
BETYdb Data Entry Workflow document. Data entry requires a login with `Create`
permissions; this can be obtained by contacting [David
LeBauer](mailto:dlebauer@illinois.edu).

### Software


The BETYdb was originally developed in MySQL and later converted to PostgreSQL.  It uses Ruby on Rails for its web portal and is hosted on a RedHat Linux Server (ebi-forecast.igb.uiuc.edu). 
BETYdb is a relational database designed in a generic way to facilitate easy
implementation of additional traits and parameters.
