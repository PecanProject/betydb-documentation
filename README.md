The BETYdb Rails App and the BETY Database
=======
The Biofuel Ecophysiological Traits and Yields Database (BETYdb) was developed to support research, agriculture, and policy by synthesizing available information on potential biofuel crops.  The BETYdb Rails Application is a Web application for interacting with that database.

This article documents both the BETY database and the BETYdb Rails application.
