The BETYdb Rails App and the BETY Database
=======
The Biofuel Ecophysiological Traits and Yields Database (BETYdb) was developed to support research, agriculture, and policy by synthesizing available information on potential biofuel crops.  The BETYdb Rails Application is a Web application for interacting with that database.

This book describes the purpose, design, and use of the Biofuel
Ecophysiological Traits and Yields database (BETYdb). BETYdb is a
database of plant trait and yield data that supports research,
forecasting, and decision making associated with the development and
production of cellulosic biofuel crops. While the content of BETYdb is
agronomic, the structure of the database itself is general and can
therefore be used more generally for ecosystem studies.

Note that this document does not cover the suite of tables used by PEcAn. 
These are covered in the [PEcAn documentation](https://github.com/PecanProject/pecan/wiki).
